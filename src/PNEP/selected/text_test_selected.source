The more she posts, the less she does. Like she had a phase for animal shelters. Remember? # Julia: Yeah. She just wouldn't shut up about it. She posted every single thing she could find on the subject! # Gail: Right. And turned out that was everything she did. Never visited one. Never donated a dime. Never did anything. # Julia: And all the time I thought she was so active and pro-active and charitable. She had me fooled ;) # Gail: U see? Spying on ppl is fun :) # Julia: Speaking of which, did u spy on me? # Gail: No, y would I? # Julia: It's fun? # Gail: Oh no! Don't get me wrong! We talk all the time, so no need to spy on u ;) # Julia: Gr8. # Gail: Besides ur pretty straightforward. # Julia: What do u mean? # Gail: When ur eating, u post food.

{ Nancy | Vic | Phil }  # Nancy: Yeah, but u can also read the news online ;) # Phil: I know, but imagine - ur keen on technology and u get all the news in one place. Then u can choose what to read and what not. # Nancy: Sounds sensible. Does it have something 4 fashion? # Phil: Probably so. Not sure, though. # Nancy: How about u, Vic? # Vic: I still prefer Facebook. Had Twitter once, but the interaction with others is nothing compared with Facebook. # Phil: Well, it's intended in a completely different way.  # Vic: What do u mean? # Phil: IMO, Twitter is not for interacting like on Facebook, but for getting news fast and from reliable, more or less, sources. U can follow anyone and anyone can follow u. # Vic: Still, on Facebook I can share stuff with my friends, join groups and talk about things that interest me. And I don't have to limit myself to 140 characters. # Phil: 280. Still, a downside. OTOH, if ppl were able to write as much as they wanted, Twitted would get as cluttered as Facebook. # Nancy: So no one uses 4 example Instagram? # Vic: I do.  # Phil: Not 4 me. I don't post that many pictures online.  # Nancy: But u can follow ppl and see what they're doing or offering. There are also companies on Instagram. # Phil: I know, but I'm more interested in news and gossip than seeing someone post a picture of their breakfast.  # Vic: That's not all ppl post on Instagram! # Phil: So, what else? # Vic: Depends on ur interest. I, for one, like to observe all the fitness accounts :) # Phil: And does this motivate u to train? # Vic: No, but it gives me hints what to do and what not.  # Nancy: What do u think about Tumblr? # Phil: What? # Vic: Heard about it, but never had an account. # Nancy: It's a microblogging website. U can post blog entries, pictures and basically everything u want there. And ppl can observe u! # Phil: Don't have that much time to write a blog. # Vic: Me neither.  # Phil: Nancy, y do u ask these questions? ;) # Nancy: I have my reasons ;)

{ Brett | Andrew | John }  # Brett: So what do u do there? Drive a tank all the time? # John: Yes and no. U've got players from around the world and they have their tank squadrons and u battle them. Can be a lot of fun! # Andrew: So what happens if someone is on a higher level than u? They basically destroy u! # John: That's not a problem. The game doesn't allow higher ranked players o interact with players out of their range. # Brett: What do u mean? # John: If ur on lvl 5, a player on lvl 30 can't attack u.  # Andrew: Sensible. Unlike WoW. # John: So what's WoW like? # Andrew: Imagine having a character u rly like and u give it a lot of ur attention and get experience point, level up and so on. Someone who's played the game for like a year comes and kills u instantly. # Brett: Not cool.  # John: Yeah. Y would they allow such a thing? # Andrew: Well, open world, u can team up with anyone, do quests together, arrange fighting tactics and so on. # Brett: Actually, my cousin met his wife there :) # John: Rly? # Brett: Yeah. They were playing together for some time, talking and at some point he invited her to a date. Turned out they lived very close to each other ;) # Andrew: That's gr8! And how are they getting along now? # Brett: Most fights are about who gets 2 play at a given moment ;)  # John: Lol # Andrew: Well my favourite genre is RPGs :) # John: Can u name a title, except WoW? # Andrew: I can name a dozen, but one of my personal faves is the Final Fantasy series :) # Brett: What's this one about? # Andrew: Don't tell me u haven't heard about the greatest RPG series of all times? # John: Well, I haven't. # Andrew: I think I'll have to look for new friends... So embarrassing. # Brett: C'mon! Tell us! # Andrew: Fine... Usually u play a group of friends that have to resolve some kind of crisis. In the last part u play a prince whose kingdom has been destroyed and u try to well get revenge. # Brett: Sounds boring.  # Andrew: Believe me, it's not!

I don't know why he says certain stuff, it seems like he's doing it on purpose # Mary: What was it this time? # Kate: Same thing, as always. Really, he knows what I think and I know what he thinks so I don't bring up certain things. I don't want to argue, but if it keeps happening, I don't see the point of talking to him # Kate: I'm angry every single time I talk with him # Mary: Eh, I don't get why he keeps doing it. What did he say? # Kate: I don't want to get worked up over it again, but really usual stuff. He watched a programme about the refugees and went on a rant about it # Mary: oh god # Kate: right?! I don't know why I'm still talking with him. I tried to talk some sense into him, apparently with no luck # Mary: What did you tell him? # Kate: What I usually tell him. He was an immigrant once, he was working abroad, I sent him all the data and research, statistics, everything. # Mary: I'm afraid Chris may be too pig-headed for that # Kate: Pfff I bet he didn't even read anything. He's just watching the nationalists, Trump and all those idiots, listens to everything they're saying on the telly instead of just thinking for once # Mary: I know, to be honest I kind of avoid these subjects when I'm talking with him # Kate: Well, I try to as well, but as you can see he can't stop himself # Kate: I know he's our friend and we go out often, but I'm not sure I can do it any more, I don't want be friends with someone who thinks that Mexican children are worse and that they should be kept away from the US # Mary: Oh my god he said that? # Kate: Yes :/ # Mary: Jesus, I knew he has strong views, but to say something like that? That's a bit too much # Kate: You're telling me this. I think we should reconsider this let's say friendship, because if every conversation will lead to something like this, I'm not interested in staying in touch with him # Mary: No wonder

Kind of... lulling you to sleep # Igor: Yeah, that guy is like David Copperfield among lecturers # Alexander: Haha David Copperfield :D # Alexander: Let's call him like that from now on! He even looks like the magician a little :D # Casper: That's a fancy nickname, I like it # Casper: But if I wanted to see a magician, I'd rather go to the circus # Igor: So... Judging from the overall tone of our discussion I feel that the decision's been already made # Igor: Am I right, gentlemen? # Casper: Actually your opinions, my noble fellows, have conirmed my conviction that going there and wasting time doesn't make sense # Alexander: Not a bit! # Alexander: And learning from Igor's last experience I think we should go somewhere else instead # Alexander: I don't want to end up snoring and getting embarrassed :D # Casper: Great, so we've reached an unanimous decision # Igor: So where are we going instead? # Casper: Let's meet near the university and we'll work something out # Igor: Agreed. # Alexander: All right!

An odd phone call with the kids. Or Tad's sister:(( Not much otherwise. # Gloria: Yeah... Life has become so quite since the kids are out of the house. We had more to get used to it. But it must hard for you. Especially you I mean. # Mell: I don't know. Sometimes I even forget that I should be missing them. In a way I do like this peace and quiet now. # Gloria: Small wonder. You had a hell of a time with them just before they went to college. I'd say you need to recover now. # Mell: I guess you're right. But maybe I should feel guilty or something? # Gloria: Don't be silly! You are a fantastic mom. # Mell: Thanks Gloria. # Gloria: Anyway I'm happy to hear from you again. We should really have a nice do again. # Mell: YES! Splendid! # Gloria: The weather is just brilliant, perfect for a BBQ. What do you think? # Mell: I'm all for it. At my place? I'd love it. # Gloria: Can't be better. I love your garden. # Mell: We're thinking about extending the terrace. I must show you my drawings, just a few ideas. It would be great to hear your opinion. # Gloria: I'd love to. But you know how little I know about garden design, or however you call it. # Mell: We'll have a look at them. Now the BBQ. At the weekend I suppose? # Gloria: Let me check the calendar. Here's our family planner. A horrible name, isn't it? So this weekend suits us fine. At the next one, on Saturday, Mark has penciled something in but I can't read it. So what about this Saturday? # Mell: Perfect. At least we know the weather holds. Shall I do the food and you the drinks? # Gloria: And I'll get us some dessert as well.  # Mell: Very good indeed. It's always so easy going with you. # Gloria: Ta! You were thinking about Tad's sister? # Mell: I'm afraid so. I'm so happy she moved up to Scotland and I don't have to put up with her trying to run my household. Tad feels relieved too. # Gloria: Good riddance! I could really never warm up to her. # Mell: Nobody can! Anyway she's gone and we're going to have a fantastic barbecue. Without her. # Gloria: Yes, we are. Oh I'm so happy you've phoned! # Mell: Looking forward to our BBQ on Saturday! # Gloria: So long!

Not every musician likes to jst perform with people he doesn't know. # Freddy: It wasn't my idea, but if you are ok with we can do it. # Simon: The only problem I have is that I can't see myself finding any free time in the coming week to practice and the concert is on Friday.

{ Sean | Rick | John }  # Sean: Friendly reminder of trade deadline today. Let's get those last minute trade request sent. # Rick: So does John get Lamar Jackson or is he scrambling for another qb?? # Sean: Nick needs to really think about rolling with Blake. John needs a QB! # John: I think I would have rights to Lamar but I think the consensus is that he's on waivers so he's open. I guess I'm just hoping RGIII and Brock play or just wait... # Rick: Crazy it happens though! he one thing in the chart that isn't addressed. We could vote and go from there. I just want you to lose a player and Nick not to get Lamar. # John: In 15 years I've never seen a ream trade a big time RB or WR  for a QB this late n the season do anything in the playoffs. That ends their season. Of course a one QB team isn't worth anything either. I have t take my chances. # Sean: Damned if you do, damned if you don't. # Rick: people's evidence  658 why the QB rule doesn't work. # John: I might have a way to drop the rule completely next year. # Sean: I guess we will have to talk about after the season. # Rick: Nobody liked my IR suggestion a couple of years ago. That solves a large percentage of the issue tho # Sean: 1 QB not 2 for a 14 league... # John: as I said, we can look at if after the season. I just wouldn't want to make it any easier. What has made the league so great its that it has been really difficult so far.
{ Carrie | Gina | Ginna | Eddie Redmayne | Newt }  # Carrie: Just back from Fantastic Beast :) # Gina: and what do you think? # Carrie: generally good - as usual nice special effect and visuals, an ok plot, a glimpse of the wizarding community in the US. # Alex: Sounds cool. I was thinking of going this weekend with Lane, but I've seen some bad reviews. # Carrie: Depends on what you expect really - I have a lot of sentiment towards Harry Potter so, I'm gonna like everything the do. But seriously the movie was decent. However, if you're expecting to have your mind blown, then no, it's not THAT good. # Gina: I agree. I saw it last week and basically I'm satisfied. # Alex: No spoilers, girls. # Carrie: no worries ;) # Carrie: And Gina, what do you think about Eddie Redmayne as Newt? # Gina: I loved him <3 I loved how introverted and awkward he was and how caring he was towards the animals. And with all that he showed a lot of confidence in his beliefs and was a genuinely compassionate character # Carrie: not your standard protagonist, that's for sure # Gina: and that's what I liked about him # Alex: Maybe I'll go and see it sooner so we can all talk about it. # Carrie: go see it. If' you're not expecting god-knows-what you're going to enjoy it ;)

{ Josie | Eco | Stefano | Salman Rushdie }  # Stefano: Hi, Josie! # Josie: Ciao, Stefano! # Stefano: So, what about Foucault's Pendulum? Do you like it? # Josie: It's... weird. Was it really written by an Italian guy? It's so... nerdy. # Stefano: Oh well, in a sense Eco was the king of nerds. And, you know, not all Italian books are about pizza, mafia and mandolino. :P # Josie: Yes, I know... I should try and read one of his novels in the original, but I'm not sure my level of Italian is adequate. # Stefano: The Name of the Rose is really difficult for a foreign speaker of Italian, you know. # Josie: And what about Foucault's Pendulum? # Stefano: Well, it's set in the 1980s, so the language is definitely more comprehensible. The content, however, is just as complicated as in the other novel. # Josie: Btw, I read Salman Rushdie's review of Pendulum, published in the 80s. # Stefano: Really? What did he say? # Josie: He hated it and said that it's not a novel, but rather a computer game. # Stefano: What? Rotfl! # Josie: That's what Salman said... # Stefano: Oh well, de gustipus non est disputandum... # Josie: De gustiBus! # Stefano: I know, it was a typo! # Josie: Disgusting pus! # Stefano: Hahaha. # Josie: Yuk! That's so creepy. # Stefano: You're the one who said it! # Josie: I know. ;)

{ Jess | Lynn | Charlie }  # Jess: Guys, last night I dreamt I was a lion tamer, does it mean I should go to Africa this summer? XD # Lynn: Or maybe you'll meet a handsome zookeeper? :D # Charlie: Or you'll get attacked by a stray cat? # Lynn: You've just spoiled all the fun! :P # Jess: Knowing my luck, Charlie might be the closest to the truth. # Charlie: Do you really believe that dreams can mean something? # Jess: No, of course not! I was just joking. It was such a surreal dream that I had to share it with you ;) # Lynn: Well... # Jess: Do you believe in dreams, Lynn? # Lynn: I'm not saying I believe, but I think that sometimes it is possible that our dreams are telling us something. Not like they can show us our future or anything like that, it's just that dreams reflect our subconsciousness, don't you think? # Jess: I guess?  # Charlie: I've read somewhere that when we see strangers in our dreams, in fact we must have seen them somewhere before. Our brain is not able to create such images on its own, it must have registered some random people's faces, and it uses them when we dream. # Jess: So you're telling me the circus owner from my dream can really be some gentleman who lives in my neighbourhood? # Charlie: Exactly! You don't even remember his face, but after you saw it just once, your brain keeps it somewhere in storage. # Lynn: WOW, it sounds really cool!
