68: { Carrie | Gina | Ginna | Eddie Redmayne | Newt }  # Carrie: Just back from Fantastic Beast :) # Gina: and what do you think? # Carrie: generally good - as usual nice special effect and visuals, an ok plot, a glimpse of the wizarding community in the US. # Alex: Sounds cool. I was thinking of going this weekend with Lane, but I've seen some bad reviews. # Carrie: Depends on what you expect really - I have a lot of sentiment towards Harry Potter so, I'm gonna like everything the do. But seriously the movie was decent. However, if you're expecting to have your mind blown, then no, it's not THAT good. # Gina: I agree. I saw it last week and basically I'm satisfied. # Alex: No spoilers, girls. # Carrie: no worries ;) # Carrie: And Gina, what do you think about Eddie Redmayne as Newt? # Gina: I loved him <3 I loved how introverted and awkward he was and how caring he was towards the animals. And with all that he showed a lot of confidence in his beliefs and was a genuinely compassionate character # Carrie: not your standard protagonist, that's for sure # Gina: and that's what I liked about him # Alex: Maybe I'll go and see it sooner so we can all talk about it. # Carrie: go see it. If' you're not expecting god-knows-what you're going to enjoy it ;)

70: { Josie | Eco | Stefano | Salman Rushdie }  # Stefano: Hi, Josie! # Josie: Ciao, Stefano! # Stefano: So, what about Foucault's Pendulum? Do you like it? # Josie: It's... weird. Was it really written by an Italian guy? It's so... nerdy. # Stefano: Oh well, in a sense Eco was the king of nerds. And, you know, not all Italian books are about pizza, mafia and mandolino. :P # Josie: Yes, I know... I should try and read one of his novels in the original, but I'm not sure my level of Italian is adequate. # Stefano: The Name of the Rose is really difficult for a foreign speaker of Italian, you know. # Josie: And what about Foucault's Pendulum? # Stefano: Well, it's set in the 1980s, so the language is definitely more comprehensible. The content, however, is just as complicated as in the other novel. # Josie: Btw, I read Salman Rushdie's review of Pendulum, published in the 80s. # Stefano: Really? What did he say? # Josie: He hated it and said that it's not a novel, but rather a computer game. # Stefano: What? Rotfl! # Josie: That's what Salman said... # Stefano: Oh well, de gustipus non est disputandum... # Josie: De gustiBus! # Stefano: I know, it was a typo! # Josie: Disgusting pus! # Stefano: Hahaha. # Josie: Yuk! That's so creepy. # Stefano: You're the one who said it! # Josie: I know. ;)
