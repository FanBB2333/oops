# Structure-Aware-BART
1.缺少参与者，即target summary中提到的人没有出现在模型的输出中 19/35=54%
e.g.
target:
Natalie is pregnant with Dave. Jane didn't think Sally should share it with others as Natalie told them that in confidence. Henriette and Greg are surprised that the father is Dave not Mike.
generation:
Natalie told Tom and Jane that she is pregnant.

2.缺少信息, 尤其是较为依赖参与者的  17/35=49%, 其中有7个是由于缺人少的
target:
Patrycja and Inez enjoyed the Italian evening. **Gosia chose a great place. Alicja hasn't been to the new restaurant**. They all want a Korean evening on Wednesday in two weeks time.
generation:
Inez and Patrycja enjoyed their evening. They will go to a restaurant in Italy and Korea again on Wednesday.

3.行为对应错误 17/35=49%, 其中也是有7个是由于缺人少的
e.g.
target:
 Gemma will invite Timmy and his Date, as well as Lona and Michelle to **her wedding**.

generation:
Gemma wants Timmy to come to ~~Lona and Michelle's wedding~~. Timmy is not sure about the date but he will come.


4.多出冗余句子(17/35)=49%,，往往是错误的(错误8/17)

# Personal Named Entity Planning
1.缺少信息（即缺少信息点），通常是整句丢失 22/35=63%，但往往不是由于缺人而少的
2.多句子(14/35=40%)，但通常是正确的(错误1/14)
e.g. 
target:
Hannah needs Betty's number but Amanda doesn't have it. She needs to contact Larry.
generation:
Hannah is looking for Betty's number. Amanda advises her to ask Larry, **who called her last time they were at the park.**

3.容易把对话中某个人零星的一句提炼到summary中



# 不同模型在不同抽象度定义下的结果

第一行是summarize前后句子中单词数的比例，第二行是summarize前后句中所有参与者名字出现次数的比例
